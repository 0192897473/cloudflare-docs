You can use a Worker to upload your image to Cloudflare Images.

Refer to the example below or refer to the [Workers documentation](/workers/) for more information.

```ts
const image = await fetch("./myimage.png");
const bytes = await image.bytes();
formData.append('file', new File([bytes], 'myimage.png');
```
