:::note
This feature requires an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.
:::

Use the [Rulesets API](/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/) to work with custom rulesets using the API.

## Deploy a custom ruleset using the API

To deploy a custom ruleset in your account, follow these general steps:

1. Create a custom ruleset, if it does not exist.
2. Deploy the custom ruleset to your account.

For more information, refer to [Work with custom rulesets](/ruleset-engine/custom-rulesets/) in the Ruleset Engine documentation.

:::caution

- Deployed custom rulesets will only apply to incoming traffic of Enterprise domains. Regarding the expression of the rule deploying the custom ruleset, you must use parentheses to enclose any custom conditions and end your expression with `and cf.zone.plan eq "ENT"` or else the API operation will fail.

- Currently, you can only deploy custom rulesets to a phase at the account level.
