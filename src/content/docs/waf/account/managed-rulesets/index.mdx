## Account-level deployment

At the account level, you can deploy each [WAF managed ruleset](/waf/managed-rules/#managed-rulesets) more than once, applying the ruleset to different subsets of incoming traffic for the Enterprise zones in your account.

<Render
	file="managed-ruleset-config-options"
	params={{
		overridesUrl:
			"/waf/account/managed-rulesets/deploy-dashboard/#configure-a-managed-ruleset",
	}}
/>
